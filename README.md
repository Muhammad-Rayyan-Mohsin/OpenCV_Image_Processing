# OpenCV_Image_Processing
This Python project utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to compose a larger image from multiple sub-images. It offers functionalities to resize, rotate, and position individual images within a larger canvas, creating visually appealing compositions.

# Image Composition with OpenCV

Features:

    Image Manipulation: Rotate and resize individual images to fit within the composition.
    Flexible Positioning: Specify positions for each sub-image within the larger canvas, allowing for creative arrangements.
    Modular Design: Easily add or remove sub-images to customize the composition.
    High-Quality Output: Produce high-resolution composite images suitable for various applications, such as digital art, graphic design, or data visualization.

# How to Use:

    Load the desired sub-images using OpenCV's cv2.imread() function.
    Resize each sub-image to a consistent size using cv2.resize().
    Apply transformations like rotation or flipping as needed.
    Define positions for each sub-image within the larger canvas.
    Combine the sub-images into a single composite image using cv2.warpAffine() and array slicing.
    Save or display the final composite image using cv2.imwrite() or cv2.imshow().

# Dependencies:

    OpenCV (cv2)
    NumPy (numpy)

This project demonstrates the power and versatility of OpenCV in manipulating and composing images programmatically. It serves as a useful tool for creating visually appealing compositions from individual image elements, providing endless possibilities for artistic expression and visual storytelling.
